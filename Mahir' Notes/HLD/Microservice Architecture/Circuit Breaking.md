# Circuit Breaking in Microservices

## 🔌 What is Circuit Breaking?

Circuit breaking is a **resilience pattern** used in microservices to stop calling a failing service temporarily to prevent further harm to the system. It's inspired by electrical circuit breakers.

## 🔁 Circuit Breaker States

1. **Closed** – All requests are allowed. Failures are monitored.
2. **Open** – Calls are blocked immediately without being sent.
3. **Half-Open** – A few test requests are allowed to check if the service has recovered.

## ❓ Why is Circuit Breaking Needed?

Microservices often depend on each other. If one fails:

- Other services might keep retrying.
- Threads may get blocked waiting for timeouts.
- System resources get exhausted.
- Leads to cascading failures.

### ✅ Benefits

- Fail fast
- Improve system stability
- Prevent cascading failures
- Enable fallback logic

## 🛠️ Tools That Support Circuit Breaking

- **Resilience4j**
- **Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker**
- **Netflix Hystrix** (deprecated)
- **Istio / Envoy**
- **Sentinel**

## 💥 Cascading Failures in Microservices

### What is a Cascading Failure?

When one service failure causes other services that depend on it to also fail, leading to a system-wide outage.

### Example Chain

```
Client → Service A → Service B → Service C
```

1. Service C fails
2. B keeps calling C → threads get blocked
3. B becomes unresponsive
4. A calls B → A also starts failing
5. Client cannot get any response

### Causes

- Blocking calls
- No timeouts or high timeouts
- No circuit breakers
- Retry storms
- Shared resource exhaustion

---

## 🛡️ Prevention Strategies

- ✅ Circuit Breakers
- ✅ Timeouts
- ✅ Bulkheads (resource isolation)
- ✅ Retries with backoff
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Asynchronous messaging (e.g., Kafka)

---

## 🤔 If We Stop Calling Failed Services, Isn't That Still a Failure?

Yes, **but it's a controlled failure**.

### ❌ Without Circuit Breaker

- Keep calling the failed service
- Timeouts, blocked threads, system crash
- Leads to **uncontrolled cascading failure**

### ✅ With Circuit Breaker

- Detects failure threshold, opens the circuit
- Stops making real calls
- Fails fast, frees up resources
- Use fallback logic or retry later
- **Degraded but stable system**

## 🧠 Key Insight

> Stopping calls doesn't remove the failure — it **contains** it. Circuit breaking is about **failing fast**, preserving system health, and avoiding a chain reaction.
