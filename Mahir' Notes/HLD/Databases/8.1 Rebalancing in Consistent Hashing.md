# 🔁 Rebalancing in Consistent Hashing

## 📘 What is Consistent Hashing?

- A technique used to distribute keys (or data) across a dynamic set of nodes.
- The hash space is arranged in a **circular ring** (0 to 2³²-1).
- Each node and key is hashed onto this ring using a consistent hash function (e.g., MD5, SHA-1).
- Each key is stored in the **first node clockwise** from its position on the ring.

## 🔄 Rebalancing in Consistent Hashing

### ➕ When a Node is Added

- The new node is hashed into the ring.
- It takes ownership of keys **between its position and the next node clockwise**.
- Only those keys are moved; all others stay unchanged.

#### ✅ Minimal Movement Example:
```text
Before:
  Hash Ring → [Node A] → [Node B]
  Key k1 maps to Node B

After:
  New Node N is added between k1 and Node B
  Now, k1 maps to Node N
````

### ➖ When a Node is Removed

- The node is removed from the ring.

- The keys it was responsible for are reassigned to the **next node clockwise**.

- Only the affected node’s keys are moved.


#### ✅ Minimal Movement Example:

```text
Before:
  Hash Ring → [Node A] → [Node B] → [Node C]
  Key k2 maps to Node B

After:
  Node B is removed
  Key k2 now maps to Node C
```

## 🧱 Virtual Nodes (VNodes)

- Each physical node is assigned **multiple virtual nodes** on the ring.

- This improves **load balancing** and **rebalance smoothness**.

- When a node is added or removed, only its virtual nodes are affected, minimizing disruption.

## 📊 Traditional Hashing vs Consistent Hashing

|Operation|Consistent Hashing ✅|Traditional Hashing ❌|
|---|---|---|
|Node added|Few keys moved|Almost all keys rehashed|
|Node removed|Few keys moved|Almost all keys rehashed|
|Scalability|Excellent|Poor|
|Fault Tolerance|High|Low|

---

## 📝 Summary

- Rebalancing occurs during **node addition** or **removal**.

- Consistent hashing ensures that only a **minimal number of keys are moved**.

- Use of **virtual nodes** further improves the balancing and fault tolerance.
