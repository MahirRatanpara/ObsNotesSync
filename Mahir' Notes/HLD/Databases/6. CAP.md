# 🧠 CAP Theorem – Notes

## ⚡ Summary
The **CAP Theorem** states that a distributed system can **only guarantee two out of three** properties at any given time:

- ✅ **Consistency (C)**: Every read gets the most recent write.
- ✅ **Availability (A)**: Every request receives a response (non-error).
- ✅ **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system works even when network partitions occur.

> ⚠️ You can only pick **2 out of 3** — not all.

## ⚖️ CAP Trade-offs

| Type | Guarantees | Sacrifices |
|------|------------|------------|
| **CP** | Consistency + Partition Tolerance | Availability |
| **AP** | Availability + Partition Tolerance | Consistency |
| **CA** | Consistency + Availability | Partition Tolerance (rare in practice) |

## 🧪 Real-World Applications

### 🔵 CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)
- **Banking Systems**
  - Must ensure strong consistency (e.g., no double-spending).
  - May reject operations during network issues.
- **Technologies**: 
  - HBase, Zookeeper, Etcd

---

### 🟢 AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)
- **Shopping Carts (Amazon)**:
  - Always respond, eventual consistency is acceptable.
- **Social Media Feeds**:
  - Stale data for a few seconds is fine, as long as it’s fast and always up.
- **Technologies**:
  - Cassandra, DynamoDB, Couchbase

---

### 🔴 CA (Consistency + Availability)
- Only feasible in **non-distributed** systems.
- **Examples**:
  - MySQL or PostgreSQL in single-node setups.
- Not tolerant to partitions → not suitable for cloud-scale systems.

## 🗃️ Database Classification by CAP

| Database              | CAP Category | Notes |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------|
| **MongoDB**           | CP / AP      | Tunable |
| **Cassandra**         | AP           | Highly available |
| **HBase**             | CP           | Strong consistency |
| **DynamoDB**          | AP           | Eventually consistent |
| **Couchbase**         | AP           | Focus on speed |
| **Zookeeper / Etcd**  | CP           | Coordination systems |
| **MySQL / PostgreSQL**| CA           | Only in non-distributed setups |

## 🧠 Use Cases and CAP Fit

| Use Case                    | Best Fit | Why |
|-----------------------------|----------|-----|
| **Bank Transaction**        | CP       | Accuracy > Availability |
| **E-commerce Cart**         | AP       | High availability preferred |
| **Social Media Feed**       | AP       | Eventual consistency OK |
| **Flight Booking System**   | CP       | Consistency critical |
| **Inventory Management**    | CP / AP  | Based on strictness of updates |

---

## 🧩 Key Takeaways
- Distributed systems must **tolerate partitions** → so only **CP or AP** are practical.
- Choose based on your system's needs:  
  - **CP**: correctness-focused  
  - **AP**: availability-focused
