Keep the database layer different from the application layer so that it can be scaled independently.


# Failover Strategies

## Cold Standby:

**Cold standby** in database failover refers to a **disaster recovery setup** where a **secondary database server (standby)** is available but **not running or synchronized in real time** with the primary server.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Inactive until failover**: The standby server is **powered off or idle** and only activated manually or semi-automatically when the primary server fails.
- **Manual intervention**: Typically requires **manual startup, configuration, and data restoration**.
- **Lag in recovery**: Recovery time is **longer** compared to hot or warm standby, since data may need to be **restored from backups**.
- **Cost-effective**: Cheaper to maintain because resources are not actively used.
### Use Case:

Suitable for **non-critical systems** where **downtime is acceptable** and **cost savings** are prioritized over high availability.

## Warm Standby:

**Warm standby** refers to a **partially active** backup server that is **kept up-to-date periodically** and can take over when the primary database server fails â€” with **moderate recovery time**.

---

### ðŸ”‘ **Key Characteristics:**

- **Server is running**, but **not actively serving traffic**.
- **Data is replicated regularly**, but **not in real-time** (e.g., log shipping, periodic snapshots).
- **Faster recovery** than cold standby but **slower** than hot standby.
- Usually requires **some manual intervention** to promote the standby to primary.
---
### âœ… **Pros:**

- **Reduced downtime** compared to cold standby.
- **Lower cost** than hot standby since it doesnâ€™t need full real-time replication.
- Can be a good balance between **cost and availability**.
---
### ðŸš« **Cons:**

- Some **data loss possible**, depending on replication frequency.
- **Failover is not immediate** and might require **manual promotion**.
---
### ðŸ“Œ Use Case:

Ideal for systems where **some downtime and minimal data loss** is tolerable, but **faster recovery** than cold standby is needed â€” e.g., internal business tools or non-critical services.

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server status**        | Turned off or idle                                | Running but not actively serving                      |
| **Data synchronization** | No real-time sync; relies on backups              | Periodic sync (e.g., log shipping, scheduled updates) |
| **Failover time**        | **Slow** â€“ requires manual setup and data restore | **Moderate** â€“ faster than cold, may need promotion   |
| **Automation**           | Mostly manual                                     | Semi-automated or manual                              |
| **Data freshness**       | Could be outdated (depends on last backup)        | Relatively fresh (depends on replication interval)    |
| **Cost**                 | Lower (idle resources)                            | Moderate (resources running but not active)           |
| **Downtime tolerance**   | Suitable when downtime is acceptable              | Suitable for limited downtime                         |

## Hot Standby:

**Hot standby** is a **real-time, fully synchronized backup** server that is **always running and ready** to take over **immediately** if the primary database fails.

- **NOTE:** we can read from the  

---
### ðŸ”‘ **Key Characteristics:**

- **Fully active server**, running and constantly updated.
- Uses [[Database Replication]] (e.g., streaming replication or synchronous replication).
- **Automatic or near-instant failover** with **minimal or no downtime**.
- Often used in **high availability (HA)** and **mission-critical systems**.
---

### âœ… **Pros:**

- **Fastest recovery** â€“ often automatic and seamless.
- **Minimal data loss**, especially with synchronous replication.
- **Ensures business continuity**.

---
### ðŸš« **Cons:**

- **High cost** â€“ requires full-time duplicate infrastructure and resources.
- **Complex setup** and monitoring needed.
- May need **load balancing** or failover automation logic.

---
### ðŸ“Œ Use Case:

Ideal for **critical systems** (e.g., banking, trading platforms, healthcare, etc.) where **even seconds of downtime or data loss** is unacceptable.
