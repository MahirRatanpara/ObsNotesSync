## 🧠 Caching Strategy – Use Cases, Combinations & Interview Guide

---

### 🔹 **1. Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)**

#### ✅ When to Use:

- Read-heavy applications (e.g., product catalog)

- You need control over what and when to cache

- Application can tolerate slightly stale data


#### ❌ Avoid if:

- Read-after-write consistency is mandatory

- Cache update logic is too complex to maintain in app


#### 📍 Example Use-Cases:

- User profiles

- Product info pages

- Blog or article rendering


---

### 🔹 **2. Read-Through Cache**

#### ✅ When to Use:

- You want abstraction: cache handles the DB read if key is missing

- Your system uses a cache provider like Redis with plugins

- Consistency is still important but less strict than write-through


#### ❌ Avoid if:

- Your application needs to cache derived/partial data

- You need full control over caching behavior


#### 📍 Example Use-Cases:

- Config service reads

- Currency exchange APIs

- Lightweight read services


---

### 🔹 **3. Write-Around Cache**

#### ✅ When to Use:

- Writes are infrequent or don't need immediate reads

- You want to avoid cache pollution with data that's rarely read


#### ❌ Avoid if:

- You expect immediate reads after writes

- You need strict read-after-write consistency


#### 📍 Example Use-Cases:

- Product inventory updates

- Admin dashboards

- Logging metadata


---

### 🔹 **4. Write-Through Cache**

#### ✅ When to Use:

- Data consistency is critical between cache and DB

- You can tolerate write latency

- Application supports synchronous dual writes


#### ❌ Avoid if:

- DB downtime must not affect app

- You're dealing with heavy write throughput


#### 📍 Example Use-Cases:

- User login session tokens

- Cart state in e-commerce

- Banking/Finance user preferences


---

### 🔹 **5. Write-Back (Write-Behind) Cache**

#### ✅ When to Use:

- You want ultra-fast writes (low latency)

- You can afford eventual consistency

- Infrastructure supports durable async queues


#### ❌ Avoid if:

- You can’t tolerate data loss (cache/queue crashes)

- DB writes must succeed in real-time


#### 📍 Example Use-Cases:

- Logging and analytics

- IoT sensor data

- Billing usage logs

## 🔗 Best Real-World Cache Combinations

|Combination|When to Use|
|---|---|
|Cache-Aside + Write-Around|Read-heavy, tolerance for stale data, better write throughput|
|Read-Through + Write-Through|Clean, consistent cache logic with manageable write volume|
|Cache-Aside + Write-Behind|Lower latency systems where eventual consistency is okay|
|Read-Through + Write-Behind|Fast write, lazy read population with async durability|
|CDN + Client-side Cache|For static resources: HTML, JS, images|
|Server Cache + DB with TTL|Dynamic but short-lived data like search suggestions|

## 💼 Real-World System Design Examples

|System/Feature|Recommended Strategy|
|---|---|
|Product Catalog|Cache-Aside + Write-Around|
|E-commerce Cart|Write-Through + Read-Through|
|Search Suggestions|Write-Behind + TTL Cache|
|Fraud Detection Counters|Write-Through|
|Logging System|Write-Behind|
|Leaderboards|Read-Through + Periodic Write-Back|
|OAuth Token Cache|Read-Through + Write-Through|

## 🧪 Bonus Tips for Interviews

- 📦 Use tools like: **Redis**, **Memcached**, **Ehcache**, **CDN (Cloudflare/Akamai)**

- 🧹 Cover eviction policies: **LRU**, **LFU**, **FIFO**, **TTL-based**

- 🧱 Add resilience via: **graceful DB fallback**, **retry + backoff**, **circuit breakers**

- 🎯 Know failure scenarios: **cache down**, **queue overflow**, **DB timeouts**
