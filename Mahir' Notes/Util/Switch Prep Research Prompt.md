# Scraping of DSA questions:

Hello, I am preparing to switch my job as a software engineer with 3 years of experience in an MnC company. I am looking to switch in a top notch company with great pay like FAANG companies, including FAANG. Now I have a good level of preparation in DSA, LLD and HLD, I need a help with creating a list of 75 DSA questions from Leetcode which are of high difficulty, non-standard and each question should be able to give me Great amount of knowledge and concept/topic clarity. Similarly I need question for LLD and HLD as well 15 questions each. Help me prepare the list of my final practice questions. Remember no standard question in DSA and should be extremely value adding. 

DSA should be from Leetcode, LLD and LLD should be real-world inspired but also can be standard and the ones which are recently asked in interviews, Please do not organize question and no topic info as well, i want mix bag
