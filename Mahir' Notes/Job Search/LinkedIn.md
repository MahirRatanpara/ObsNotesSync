Thanks! I’ll put together a guide on how to best use LinkedIn Premium as a mid-level software developer actively applying to roles at Big Tech companies, and how to optimize your profile for recruiter visibility.  
I'll let you know as soon as it's ready.

# Maximizing LinkedIn Premium for Your Software Development Job Search

Optimize your LinkedIn profile first. Use a **clear, keyword-rich headline** that goes beyond your current title (for example, “Backend Software Engineer | Node.js, AWS”). A good headline helps your profile show up in recruiter searches. Write a detailed **About/Summary** section that tells your story and why you do what you do (not just a bullet list of tasks). List **relevant skills** (programming languages, frameworks, tools, etc.) – aim for 5 or more key skills. LinkedIn data shows profiles with ≥5 skills listed get about _3× more connection requests_. Make sure your skills match the headline and experience you want (e.g. Cloud, DevOps, system design), since LinkedIn’s skill tags feed directly into recruiter search filters. Get endorsements for your top skills (endorsements from peers add credibility and improve algorithmic visibility).

Highlight achievements in each job entry: use bullet points with metrics or outcomes (e.g. “Built REST APIs in Node.js that served 100K+ users, cutting latency by 25%” instead of just “Developed APIs”). Recruiters notice concrete results. Request a few **recommendations** from managers or colleagues who worked with you closely; specific testimonials (even a short quote on a key project) carry more weight than just titles. Ensure your **location** is up-to-date and, if you’re open to relocating (or working in specific regions), say so in your profile. Many recruiters filter searches by location.

Use LinkedIn’s **#OpenToWork** setting to signal that you’re job searching. When you enable OpenToWork and specify desired job titles and locations, LinkedIn will make your profile appear in relevant recruiter searches. You can choose to show this to recruiters only (so your current company won’t see the banner). Finally, use a **professional photo and custom URL**: LinkedIn advises a recent headshot (face ~60% of the frame, wear business-casual attire, smile with your eyes). A polished photo and profile give a strong first impression to recruiters.

## Leverage Premium Job-Search Features

LinkedIn Premium **Career** includes tools that can accelerate your search. For example, it offers an **AI Profile Writing Assistant** – use it to refine your summary and skills so you stand out. Premium also provides **job match insights** on listings (showing how well you match a role). You get five **InMail** credits per month – use these to message hiring managers or recruiters outside your network. Applicants who send InMails to job posters are reported to be ~3× more likely to get hired. As a Premium subscriber you can also turn on **Open Profile**, which allows _any_ LinkedIn member to message you for free. This can increase inbound interest from recruiters and colleagues who find you via search.

Use Premium’s **“Top Applicant”** feature (if available in your plan). It highlights jobs where you rank among the top candidates based on your profile information. Focus applications on those roles where you fit best. You can also mark certain job listings as **“Top Choice”** – LinkedIn will signal to recruiters that you’re especially interested in those roles. Premium also unlocks advanced search filters: for example, use the **Actively Hiring** filter under People search to find individuals (recruiters or managers) who have indicated they’re currently hiring. In the Jobs search, filter by company (e.g. Google, Amazon) or title (“Software Engineer”) and save those searches. Premium’s filtering and alerts help you quickly spot new openings at your target companies.

Regularly check **“Who viewed your profile”** (Premium lets you see viewers for the past 365 days). If a recruiter or Googler has viewed you, consider reaching out. Finally, use **LinkedIn Learning**: take in-demand courses (e.g. on cloud services, machine learning, advanced programming) and add completed course badges to your profile. This not only sharpens skills but shows recruiters you’re proactive about learning.

## Network Actively and Engage on LinkedIn

Building connections and visibility is crucial. Proactively **connect** with former coworkers, alumni, and industry peers. Search for recruiters or engineers at your target companies (for example, “Technical Recruiter Google” or “Software Engineer at Amazon”) and send a concise, customized connection request. Mention a mutual interest or the role you’re seeking – avoid generic “I need a job” messages. Once connected, it’s polite to follow up after a day or two with a brief note (e.g. “Thanks for connecting! I’m exploring roles like [Role] at [Company] and would appreciate any advice.”). Also connect with colleagues and other professionals in your field – a larger network means your profile shows up more often.

Be **active** on LinkedIn. Share relevant content at least once a week: post about project milestones, new certifications, tech articles you’ve found useful, or your take on industry news. LinkedIn data suggests that posting (even modest updates) “builds visibility” and signals to recruiters that you’re engaged. Comment on and like posts from others in your field or from companies you target – this keeps your name and profile visible in recruiters’ feeds. Join and participate in LinkedIn groups for software developers or tech specializations. The more you comment and share (in an insightful way), the more likely you are to come up in searches. In fact, one LinkedIn recruiter advice source notes _“the more active you are, the more likely you are to be noticed by recruiters.”_.

Seek **endorsements and recommendations**. Endorse connections for skills (often they will endorse you back). Endorsements improve how LinkedIn ranks you for those skills. As mentioned, request recommendations from past managers or teammates – genuine, specific testimonials can sway a recruiter reviewing your profile.

## Target Big Tech Companies

To break into large tech firms, tailor your approach. **Follow** the LinkedIn pages of your target companies (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Apple). Engage with their posts (like or thoughtful comments); this can put you on their radar. **Filter jobs by company**: in the Jobs tab, use Advanced Filters to select your target companies and set up email alerts. Save searches for “Software Engineer at [Company] in [Location]” to get notified immediately of new openings. When you see a suitable posting, apply and then use InMail or connections to reach out to the recruiter or hiring manager. If you mark a role at one of your target companies as “Top Choice,” LinkedIn signals that you’re very interested, which can draw more recruiter attention.

Build connections inside those companies. Use LinkedIn to find alumni or ex-colleagues who work at those firms; politely ask for a referral or insights on the hiring process. A referral can dramatically increase your chances. Meanwhile, ensure your profile **speaks the language of Big Tech**: highlight experience with large-scale systems, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), machine learning, or other in-demand technologies. As the earlier advice noted, include these specific skills in your profile so recruiters can find you for those roles.

Finally, treat LinkedIn as part of your daily job search routine. Regularly log in to check messages, new connections, and job recommendations. LinkedIn reports that Premium Career users are on average **2.6× more likely to get hired** on the platform (and get ~11× more profile views) than free users. By optimizing your profile, using Premium’s tools, and engaging actively with the community, you’ll maximize your visibility to recruiters and greatly increase your chances of landing interviews and offers in the software development field.
